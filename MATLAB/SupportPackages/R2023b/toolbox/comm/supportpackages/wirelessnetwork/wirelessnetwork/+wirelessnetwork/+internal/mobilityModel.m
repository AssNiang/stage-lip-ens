    %   mobilityModel methods:
    %
    %   position - Returns the current position in 3-D Cartesian coordinates,
    %              representing the [x y z] position in meters.
    %   velocity - Returns the current velocity in 3-D Cartesian coordinates,
    %              representing the [x y z] velocity in meters per second.

    methods (Abstract)
        %position Return the position of the node at current time
        pos = position(obj, currentTime)

        %Velocity Return the velocity of the node at current time
        vel = velocity(obj, currentTime)
    end
