    %   TransmitterPosition - Position of transmitter, specified as a
    %                         real-valued vector in cartesian coordinates

    %                         second. The default value is [0 0 0].
    %   NumTransmitAntennas - Number of antennas at the transmitter. The
    %                         default value is [].
    %   StartTime           - Packet transmission start time at the
    %                         transmitter or packet arrival time at the

    %   CenterFrequency     - Center frequency of the carrier in Hz. The
    %                         default value is [].
    %   Bandwidth           - Carrier bandwidth in Hz. It is the
    %                         bandwidth around the center frequency.The default
    %                         value is [].
    %   Abstraction         - A logical scalar representing the abstraction
    %                         type. It takes a value of true or false which
    %                         represents abstracted PHY, or full PHY
    %                         respectively. The default value is false.
    %   SampleRate          - Sample rate of the packet, in samples per
    %                         second. It is only applicable when
    %                         Abstraction value is set to false. The
    %                         default value is [].
    %   DirectToDestination - A numeric integer scalar. A value of 0 indicates
    %                         it is a normal packet and is transmitted over
    %                         the channel. A nonzero value represents a
    %                         destination node ID and also indicates that
    %                         it is a special packet, where the channel
    %                         model is bypassed and transmitted directly to
    %                         the destination node. The default value is 0.
    %   Data                - Contains time samples (full PHY) or frame
    %                         information (abstracted PHY). If Abstraction
    %                         is set to false, this field contains
    %                         time-domain samples of the packet represented
    %                         as a T-by-R matrix of complex values. T is
    %                         the number of time-domain samples. R is the
    %                         number of transmitter antennas if the packet
    %                         represents the transmitted packet or number
    %                         of receiver antennas if the packet represents
    %                         the received packet. If Abstraction is set to
    %                         true, this field contains the standard specific
    %                         information.
    %   Metadata            - A structure representing the technology-specific,
    %                         abstraction-specific, and channel information.
    %                         It contains the following fields.
    %             Channel - It is a structure representing the channel
    %             information with these fields:
    %                 PathGains - Complex path gains at each snapshot in
    %                 time. It is a matrix of size Ncs-by-Np-by-Nt-by-Nr. The
    %                 default value is [].
    %                 PathDelays - Delays in seconds corresponding to each
    %                 path. It is a vector of size 1-by-Np. The default value
    %                 is [].
    %                 PathFilters - Filter coefficients for each path. It is a
    %                 matrix of size Np-by-Nf. The default value is [].
    %                 SampleTimes - Simulation time in seconds corresponding to
    %                 each path gains snapshot. It is a vector of size
    %                 Ncs-by-1. The default value is [].
    %             Here Ncs, Np, Nt, Nr, and Nf represents number of channel
    %             snapshots, number of paths, number of transmit antennas,
    %             number of receive antennas, and number of filter coefficients
    %             respectively.
